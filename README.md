The main page contains the different **levels** for the computer science program. Each level includes:
- **Books**: Textbooks or reference materials for the course.
- **Slides**: Lecture slides for each topic.
- **Helpful Resources**: Additional tutorials, videos, or links to external resources.

 ## 4. Level Resources Page Flowchart

-A list of books specific to the selected level.
-Users can browse and download the available books for that level.

# Setup

 In order to obtain the resources:
1.<git clone https://github.com/LeenMusaadd/StudyGuide/tree/master>` is the first step in cloning the repository.
2. To view all of the course resources on the homepage, open the `HomePage.html` file in your browser.

# Technology Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS**:  To ensure the responsiveness and style of the pages.
- **JavaScript**:  For the interactivity and functionality of the site (e.g., loading books, filtering resources).
- **Node.js**: utilized for managing requests between the frontend and the database, controlling backend logic, and server-side scripting.
- **MongoDB**:The books for every course, along with administrative data, are stored and retrieved using a NoSQL database.

# Goals

These are the website's main objectives:
1.To offer a centralized site where computer science students can access books for their classes.
2.To develop an interface for administrators to efficiently manage book listings and keep the site updated.
3.To help students easily access books for particular courses by allowing them to navigate by course level.

# Future Work

1.Search Functionality: provide an advanced search function that lets users separate materials based on keywords, course names, or other criteria.
2.User Accounts: Add user accounts so that students can save their favorite resources or track their progress.
